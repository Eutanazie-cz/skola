# Jokes

A small application, which tells you jokes. A joke is sent from public API page after clicking the button "Tell me a random joke".

## Development server

Run `ng serve` or with NodeJS (version v12) `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
